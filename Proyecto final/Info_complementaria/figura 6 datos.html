1 mm<SUP>2</SUP> mucosal surface, representing 1 mm<SUP>3</SUP> in volume, was homogenized with a sterile tissue grinder into suspension in 0.6 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. This suspension was inoculated onto nine blood agar plates and cultured at 37°C in aerobic, microaerobic (5% CO<SUB>2</SUB>), or anaerobic environments. More than 2,000 colonies grew on each plate, predominantly <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#97;</FONT>
